54257,10,"Nita's Note: I note that some of you are using game meat such as deer -- Deer is a very DRY meat. It is wise to HAVE some fat added to the deer -- especially to ground deer. Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult an expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman."

46479,4,During the summer I reduce the yeast to 1 tsp because it seems to rise so much more during the summer than the winter. Or you could increase the salt slightly (salt kills the yeast so it doesn't rise out of the machine!)  So if you're getting a really huge loaf (and some of you have) try one of these 2 things and it should be better for you. For some reason atmospheric pressure (which varies according to seasons) makes a difference in how a bread rises.  Enjoy!
