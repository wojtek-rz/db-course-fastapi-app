67256,82367,Best Ever Banana Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting,75,"This is one of (if not) the best banana cake i have ever tasted! i thought the oven temp of 275° sounded a little low, but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. i do not know if the little ""freezer trick"" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but i did it, and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. would be interesting to see if it still came out as great if this step was skipped. all i know is that i followed this recipe exactly as stated (except that i had no buttermilk, so i subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and i got exceptional results. so moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... i personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o)  depending on the amount of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. i used the full recipe and had some leftover. i sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...to die for! i really liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! it got better each day it sat, i always make this cake at least the day before i need or want it.  i was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over again!! so glad i came across this one!! (on another website).

recipe. have spaghetti one night and lasagna later!  thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review.  i read and appreciate every one of them!  chef note:  after i posted this recipe i remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when i make a batch of spaghetti i just help myself to a splash of it. on one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so i got out the corkscrew and helped myself. for some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. my husband asked what wine i put in it and i showed him the bottle. he nearly fell off the chair. i had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss. goes to show you--don't use a wine for cooking you wouldn't drink. you get the best results from a good wine!",2002-03-17,1326,2

*the liquid will thicken to a glaze if you are patient. it just takes a bit of time. if you feel your chicken is cooked (and going to overcook) remove it before going on to reduce the liquid. same thing, if you must use breast meat, remove it (so it doesn't dry out) and continue reducing the liquid . if you do it this way rather than thickening with cornstarch you will get a richer glaze and not need to add stock or broth instead of the water. it just takes patience. and note: a glaze is sticky and coats the meat, this is not a sauce.",2003-08-13,973,1

i noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. you can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. the smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor.

100727,1535,"Thick, Soft, and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies",25,"I moved out of the house in 1992 but my dad still insist i make his chocolate chip cookies for him. after much searching these are the ones we deemed ""best"". soft and chewy but with a lightly crisp outer layer. if you don't want the crispness, substitute more butter for the shortening. 

i have found that you need to follow the directions *exactly* to get the best cookies. not using real butter or all brown sugar, not beating the eggs in one at a time, not baking them at a higher temp than the ""traditional"" recipe, all make a difference in the end result. 

i have also found that land o' lake butter makes a better cookie than some generic brand butter. don't let the butter sit out too long. it needs to soften but if it sits until the moisture starts to separate from the butter, it is too soft and it will affect the resulting cookies. if that happens, refrigerate the dough for about an hour to help them not spread as much. it also helps to use the mixer on the dough in between batches going into the oven. it helps keep the dough from starting to separate if it is a warm day. 

another thing i've learned is you have to make sure there is plenty of circulation in your oven. when i moved, my cookies started turning out flat again. i finally realized that my oven was smaller at the new house and when i switched to smaller cookie sheets, my cookies turned out perfectly!",2004-09-28,229,0

bring 2 cups of veggie broth ( can use bouillon and water) per 1 cup bulgur

when broth is boiling stir in bulgur. cover and simmer about 15 minutes or until bulgur is soft. all the broth should be absorbed. fluff the bulgur with a fork as you would rice and add to your recipe.

304982,367711,Tiramisu Cupcakes (Uses Cake Mix),58,"These are delicious tiramisu cupcakes.  they are relatively easy to make as they use a boxed cake mix.  read recipe in entirety first - it sounds more complex then it actually is.  you can decorate these to be quite elegant & fancy in presentation for brunches, bridal showers, or whatever suits your needs.  these sell at gourmet bakeries, coffee shops & cafe's for a pretty penny.  note:  i do use mascarpone to make these as that is more traditional, but you could substitute with plain cream cheese if needed.
also, i do use cupcake liners because i think they present better.
lastly, it's best to prepare mascarpone filling & chill about 4-6 hours in advance or night before.
fyi:  you can fill the cupcakes by using a icing decorating (piping) bag filled with the mascarpone filling or use an old fashioned ketchup or mustard plastic bottle with nozzle point tip << yes, those ugly yellow & red things :-)
*** update:  some of you contacted me about skipping the pastry bag step, that's completely fine, what you need to do is leave room when filling cupcake wrappers by not filling all the way, after cupcakes are baked, you poke the holes & do the liquid coffee over top of poked cakes, then just top with the mascarpone layer (make sure it's chilled well as it thickens) then just use the cream cheese frosting on top of that & top with chocolate shavings.",2008-05-27,62,1

181870,224921,The Clockmaker's Caramel Coated Popcorn (A Haunted Recipe),15,"In 1921, a german born clockmaker quit his well respected job to open a popcorn stand in chicago’s wicker park district. the clockmaker’s typical fare was freshly popped popcorn drizzled with warm butter and sprinkled with salt; but his favorite, and most beloved popcorn, was his caramel coated popcorn. the recipe he used to make it was given to him from his only true love, who tragically died four years earlier during world war i. the tattered and torn recipe, which was scribbled on the inside of an old playbill, was carefully framed and sealed in an exquisite frame. the clockmaker faithfully took the framed recipe with him everywhere he went.  

by the summer of 1924, the clockmaker’s caramel coated popcorn had captivated the entire city’s attention; everyone was frantically lining up at his busy stand to buy the sweet, sticky confection. a few months later, just as the clockmaker was preparing to close his stand for the day, a small fire ignited near the stove. the clockmaker instinctively ran out to call for help. when he returned, just seconds later, he remembered leaving the framed recipe hanging on the wall. the clockmaker quickly ran into the burning stand to retrieve the recipe, but he never made it out.

when the fire inspectors went into the charred ruins to investigate the accident, they found the clockmaker’s frame lying in a pile of smoking debris. the frame was in pristine condition; not a dent, nor a blemish, could be seen on it. however, the recipe was gone.  

the recipe for the clockmaker’s caramel popcorn recently surfaced and is beginning to circulate around the globe. unfortunately, many people think the recipe is haunted because it is believed that if your clock stops running after making the recipe it’s because the clockmaker has paid you a visit in hopes of reclaiming his long, lost recipe.

note:  this recipe, as written, results in a sticky, chewy caramel popcorn.  if you prefer a crunchier caramel popcorn, bake it in the oven at 250 degrees for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.",2006-08-15,62,2

note: this dish can easily be frozen after baking, then thawed out and reheated.  i do not recommend freezing without baking first, since potatoes will sometimes get mushy if frozen uncooked.  i personally do not like a tin baking pan for this particular recipe, especially for freezing, since it can sometimes impart a ""tinny"" taste. also, if this recipe is baked in a glass baking dish and then frozen, the glass will shatter if not at room temperature.  so, if  freezing in a glass baking dish, i recommend baking and freezing in corning ware since it will not break.",2003-04-18,51,0

update:  i spent an afternoon with my mom at the original nuway location down on east douglas in wichita, ks and was able to refine the recipe a bit more after talking to someone who had worked there for years.  i've adjusted the recipe to reflect the information i was given, to be more precise.  i found they cook the meat at a high heat in a cast iron cooker, then hold it at around 200 degrees to serve the lunch crowd.  i was told there is no seasoning in the meat, but that all the flavor is what is on the bun.  i made these again to test that theory, and realized the dill pickles are salty enough that you don't need any extra seasoning. i orginally had counted the ""holding"" time and realized this actually only takes minutes to cook.   sometimes the best things are ultimately simple!  these are the real deal.",2003-04-06,27,1
